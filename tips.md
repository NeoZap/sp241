# TIPS

* Tip#1
  **Understand the Kernel:** Start with a high-level understanding of the Linux kernel architecture.
  Resources like ["The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide"](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/) by Peter Jay Salzman, Michael Burian, Ori Pomerantz, Bob Mottram, Jim Huang can be very helpful.
* Tip#2
  **Master low-level languages:** Low-level languages such as C/C++ are the primary language for system programming due to their performance and low-level capabilities. Though Rust is an honorable mention, it isn't used widely in the Linux environment.
* Tip#3
  **Linux From Scratch (LFS):** Go through the LFS book to understand how a Linux system is built from the ground up. This will give you insight into how Linux was compiled and built!
* Tip#4
  **Learn Kernel Modules:** Learn the structure of a kernel module, how to write and compile them. You can see ["The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide"](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/) book and start with making the "Hello World" kernel module.
* Tip#5
  **Ask ChatGPT:** [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) can help you create simple scripts, and become your study partner! But, don't put too much trust on them because they are just an AI, thus very prone in making wrong answers.
